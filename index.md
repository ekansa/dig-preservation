AIA and SCS Joint Annual Meeting - January 4â€“7, 2018
SESSION 2K: Workshop
Digital Preservation: Tools and Strategies for Preserving Archaeological Data for Future Generations

Issues of sustainable digital preservation need to be more uniformly addressed
within the archaeological community. Enthusiasm for integrating new digital
recording methods into archaeological practice is high, but this rarely includes
concrete plans for to how to manage and store these files over the long-term. As
cultural heritage and academic institutions begin to develop or update their digital
preservation best practices, how can we contribute to the conversation? This
workshop will address combatting issues implementing digital preservation at an
institutional level, as well as digital preservation issues that arise with digitized
and born-digital archaeological objects, records, and data, regardless of the size
or length of the project. Participants will have the opportunity to break out into
small groups to workshop solutions they are experiencing in preserving their research.
Demonstrations of some digital preservation and version control tools will
be given. Participants should bring laptops.

This is one of the situations that [version control]({{ page.root
}}/reference/#version-control) was designed to help with.  Instead of sharing
files back and forth, we track changes in a version control system:

*   Nothing that is committed to version control is ever lost, unless
    you work really, really hard at it. Since all old versions of
    files are saved, it's always possible to go back in time to see
    exactly who changed what on a particular day, or what version of a
    program was used to generate a particular set of results.

*   As we have this record of who made what changes when, we know who to ask
    if we have questions later on, and, if needed, revert to a previous
    version, much like the "undo" feature in an editor.

*   When several people collaborate in the same project, it's possible to
    accidentally overlook or overwrite someone's changes. The version control
    system automatically notifies users whenever there's a conflict between one
    person's work and another's.

Teams are not the only ones to benefit from version control: individuals can also benefit
immensely. Keeping a record of what was changed, when, and why is extremely useful for
any person if they ever need to come back to the project later on (e.g., a year later,
when memory has faded). It can also be helpful when creating formal project documentation
following the conclusion of a project, or when planning similar projects in the future.

Version control isn't just for software, either: books, papers, documentation,
metadata, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and
should be stored in a version control system.
