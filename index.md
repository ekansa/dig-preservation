### SESSION 2K: Workshop
### Digital Preservation: Tools and Strategies for Preserving Archaeological Data for Future Generations

*Issues of sustainable digital preservation need to be more uniformly addressed
within the archaeological community. Enthusiasm for integrating new digital
recording methods into archaeological practice is high, but this rarely includes
concrete plans for to how to manage and store these files over the long-term. As
cultural heritage and academic institutions begin to develop or update their digital
preservation best practices, how can we contribute to the conversation? This
workshop will address combatting issues implementing digital preservation at an
institutional level, as well as digital preservation issues that arise with digitized
and born-digital archaeological objects, records, and data, regardless of the size
or length of the project. Participants will have the opportunity to break out into
small groups to workshop solutions they are experiencing in preserving their research.
Demonstrations of some digital preservation and version control tools will
be given. Participants should bring laptops.*
