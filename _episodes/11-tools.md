There are a number of different graphical user interface (GUI) apps for Git
available which many people prefer for their daily work. You might wonder why we
had you start with the command line, if GUIs are available? The main reason is
that most GUIs only contain a subset of Git functionality and knowing how to use
the command line is necessary to use and understand Git at its' fullest
capacity.

## GUI Application Example
## 
Here is an example of a popular GUI called GitKraken being used to perform the
following: 
*   creating a new branch
*   staging a file
*   performing a commit
*   checking out a branch
*   merging a branch
*   deleting a branch
