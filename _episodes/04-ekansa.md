As we saw in the previous lesson, we can refer to commits by their
identifiers.  You can refer to the _most recent commit_ of the working
directory by using the identifier `HEAD`.

We've been adding one line at a time to `README.md`, so it's easy to track our
progress by looking, so let's do that using our `HEAD`s.  Before we start,
let's make another change to `README.md`. Open the file in your editor, and add another line:

~~~
If you would like, you can also put images of dogs and hexagonal software logos here.
~~~
{: .output}

Your `README.md` should now look like:
~~~
# about your new image collection

The `cats-human-situations.csv` file contains metadata for three image objects.
The original metadata from the source institutions has been abbreviated and made
messier so you have something to clean up!

The images are in the `images/` subdirectory of this repository.
If you would like, you can also put images of dogs and hexagonal software logos here.

~~~
{: .output}

The real goodness in all this is when you can refer to previous commits.
We do that by adding `~1` to refer to the commit one before `HEAD`.

~~~
$ git diff HEAD~1 README.md
~~~
{: .bash}

If we want to see the differences between older commits we can use `git diff`
again, but with the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to them:

~~~
$ git diff HEAD~2 README.md
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index f2a73f2..ef91fa5 100755

We could also use `git show` which shows us what changes we made at an older commit as
well as the commit message, rather than the _differences_ between a commit and our working
directory that we see by using `git diff`.

$ git show HEAD~2 README.md

In this way, we can build up a chain of commits.  The most recent end of the
chain is referred to as `HEAD`; we can refer to previous commits using the `~`
notation, so `HEAD~1` (pronounced "head minus one") means "the previous commit",
while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using those long strings of digits and letters that
`git log` displays.  Our first commit was given the ID
`e46e6eb89b9b4c7d95e9ea21337d9b29f78930b8`, so let's try this (your starting
commit may have a different hash!):

That's the right answer, but typing out random 40-character strings is
annoying, so Git lets us use just the first few characters, e.g.: `git diff 1ecad50 README.md`.

All right! So we can save changes to files and see what we've changedâ€”now how
can we restore older versions of things?  Let's suppose we accidentally
overwrite our file. Open `README.md` in your editor and replace the contents
with the following line:

~~~
Dogs and hexagonal software logos as data.
~~~
{: .output}

`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been staged:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        .gitignore
        cats-human-situations.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~
{: .output}

We can put things back the way they were by using `git checkout`:

~~~
$ git checkout HEAD README.md
~~~
{: .bash}

As you might guess from its name,`git checkout` checks out (i.e., restores) an
old version of a file. In this case, we're telling Git that we want to recover
the version of the file recorded in `HEAD`, which is the last saved commit. If
we want to go back even further, we can use a commit identifier instead:

~~~
$ git checkout e46e6e README.md
~~~
{: .bash}

You can now open the `README.md` file in your editor to confirm you have the
original version of the file again.  Git has, of course, noticed:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	cats-human-situations.csv

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~
{: .output}

Again, we can put things back the way they were by using `git checkout`:

~~~
$ git checkout -f master README.md
~~~
{: .bash}

> You can fix this by reattaching your head using ``git checkout master``
{: .callout}

It's important to remember that we must use the commit number that identifies
the state of the repository *before* the change we're trying to undo.  A common
mistake is to use the number of the commit in which we made the change we're
trying to get rid of.  In the example below, we want to retrieve the state from
before the most recent commit (`HEAD~1`), which is commit `2199d6`:

![Git Checkout](../fig/git-checkout.svg)

{: .callout}

The fact that files can be reverted one by one tends to change the way people organize
their work. If everything is in one large document, it's hard (but not impossible) to undo
changes to the introduction without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion.
If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files, on the other hand,
moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.
